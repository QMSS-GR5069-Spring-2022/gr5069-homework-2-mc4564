#My model uses the per capita farm income in each state to predict 2012 presidential election.
#My model was not very successful in predicting the results. My model predicts the democrats to win a literal landslide with 49 states.
#I am not entirely sure about how to understand the predictions.
#It appears that no matter what level of farm in come you are on, democrats should win the state.
#My model has an accuracy score of 55%, by comparing '12party' and '12predict'.
#Having more varialbes to predict from will greatly increase the accuracy of my model. 
#I used the get_csv function from previous codes to help get csv file.
